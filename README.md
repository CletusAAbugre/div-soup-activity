Div Soup Activity – Semantic HTML Refactor  

This project is part of my Advanced Front-end Web Development assignment.  

I refactored the original `index.html` file into a semantic version named ;index.semantic.html.  

 What I Did
- Replaced `<div>` wrappers with semantic tags like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, `<aside>`, and `<footer>`.  
- Used proper headings (`h1–h6`) in a logical order.  
- Added <figure> + <figcaption>for the hero image.  
- Used <blockquote> for the pull quote.  
- Converted related links into a semantic <section>with a list structure.  
- Ensured the sidebar is wrapped in <aside>.  
- Added an accessible <label> for the search input field.  

Files Included
index.semantic.html  the refactored semantic HTML file
